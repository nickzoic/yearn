# The read format (Ultima IV) and write format (minetest) are so different that
# the easiest way to convert between them is an intermediate format. We could
# come up with a way to do this on-the-fly but RAM is cheap so let's store it
# all in bytes buffers, one byte per voxel.

# Axis conventions are from minetest:
#  X: West -> East
#  Y: Down -> Up
#  Z: South -> North
# https://docs.luanti.org/for-players/coordinates/
#
# All three axes are limited to Â±30,000 or so:
# https://docs.luanti.org/for-players/world-boundaries/
#
# Minetest maps are broken into 16x16x16 "chunks" so we'll store them
# that way in memory as well.
# "The locations of each block in the chunk is given by ((z%16)*16*16 + (y%16)*16 + (x%16))"
# https://github.com/luanti-org/luanti/blob/master/doc/world_format.md#node-data
#
# The overhead of storing 1,000,000 or so chunks in separate buffers isn't much
# so let's do that. Unused chunks default to all zeros, which we can map to "air".

# Minetest uses "itemstrings" to describe its various blocks, we don't 
# want to store these so we keep a table translating them to byte values.

# available block types in the base game are listed at:
#     https://wiki.minetest.org/Games/Minetest_Game/Nodes
# for full representation of villages etc we might need
# to make some custom "letter blocks", etc.
